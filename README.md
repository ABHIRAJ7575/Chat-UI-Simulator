A clean, dark-mode, WhatsApp-inspired chat UI simulator built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
No frameworks. No backend. No “just install 27 npm packages and pray” energy.

This project focuses on realistic chat behavior, smooth UI interactions, and a frontend structure that won’t make future-you question life choices 😌

Demo

Live Preview: View Demo

Open it, type a message, feel productive for 5 seconds, then admire the UI like a true frontend dev 😎

Features

Dark-mode only (because light mode is a personal attack at night 🌚)

Mobile-first responsive layout (thumb-friendly, coffee-approved ☕)

Multiple chat threads (yes, you can ghost more than one chat)

Message persistence using LocalStorage (your messages won’t disappear like motivation)

Sent & received message bubbles with timestamps

Simulated delivered and read indicators (double ticks included, emotions not included 🫠)

Typing indicator animation (to increase anxiety, just like real life)

Keyboard support

Enter → Send

Shift + Enter → New line (for dramatic long messages)

Smooth transitions and auto-scrolling (no teleporting messages here)

Tech Stack

HTML5 – clean structure, no div soup 🍲

CSS3 – modern styling with CSS variables

Vanilla JavaScript – because sometimes you don’t need a framework, just logic

No React. No Angular. No “Hello World” app weighing 300MB.

Project Structure
index.html   → layout & structure
style.css    → UI styling & animations
script.js    → chat logic & interactions


Simple, readable, and not hiding logic inside 15 folders.

Purpose

This project demonstrates:

Practical UI/UX thinking

Frontend state handling without a backend

Clean code organization

Attention to micro-interactions that actually matter

Basically, it’s proof that good UI doesn’t require a framework — just patience and taste 🎯
